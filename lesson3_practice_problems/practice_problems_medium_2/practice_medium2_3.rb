# Practice Problems: Medium 2-3

=begin
Call a method, pass two strings as arguments and see how they can be treated 
differently depending on the method invoked on them inside the method 
definition.

Study the following code and state what will be displayed...and why:

def tricky_method(string_param_one, string_param_two)
  string_param_one += "rutabaga"
  string_param_two << "rutabaga"
end

string_arg_one = "pumpkins"
string_arg_two = "pumpkins"
tricky_method(string_arg_one, string_arg_two)

puts "String_arg_one looks like this now: #{string_arg_one}"
puts "String_arg_two looks like this now: #{string_arg_two}"

arg_one will be "pumpkins" because assignment doesn't mutate.
arg_two will be "pumpkinsrutabaga" since << mutates
=end

def tricky_method(string_param_one, string_param_two)
  string_param_one += "rutabaga"
  string_param_two << "rutabaga"
end

string_arg_one = "pumpkins"
string_arg_two = "pumpkins"
tricky_method(string_arg_one, string_arg_two)

puts "String_arg_one looks like this now: #{string_arg_one}"
puts "String_arg_two looks like this now: #{string_arg_two}"
