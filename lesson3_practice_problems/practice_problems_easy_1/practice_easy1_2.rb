=begin
! in Ruby: When used is front this is used as a not symbol.
  When used after, can mean the bang suffix and also indicate
  a destructive method but not always.
? in Ruby: Functions that end with this only return a boolean.

1) what is != and where should you use it?
Not equal to

2) put ! before something, like !user_name
Not whatever follows

3) put ! after something, like words.uniq!
Adding the bang suffix in this case, has the uniq! method changing or mutating
  the caller

4) put ? before something
# ? : is ternary operator for if...else but not the question?

5) put ? after something
That function will usually return a boolean object, meaning true or false.

6) put !! before something, like !!user_name
Not not so ==

=end
